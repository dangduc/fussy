[[https://github.com/jojojames/fussy/actions][file:https://github.com/jojojames/fussy/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main]]
[[https://melpa.org/#/fussy][file:https://melpa.org/packages/fussy-badge.svg]]
[[https://stable.melpa.org/#/fussy][file:https://stable.melpa.org/packages/fussy-badge.svg]]

This is a package to provide a ~completion-style~ to Emacs that is able to
leverage [[https://github.com/lewang/flx][flx]] as well as various other
fuzzy matching scoring packages to provide intelligent scoring and sorting.

This package is intended to be used with packages that leverage
~completion-styles~, e.g. ~completing-read~ and ~completion-at-point-functions~.

It is usable with ~icomplete~ (as well as ~fido-mode~), ~selectrum~,
~vertico~, ~corfu~, ~helm~ and ~company-mode~'s ~company-capf~.

It is not currently usable with ~ido~ which doesn't support
~completion-styles~ and has its own sorting and filtering system.  In
addition to those packages, other ~company-mode~ backends will not hook into
this package.  ~ivy~ support can be somewhat baked in following
https://github.com/jojojames/fussy#ivy-integration but the
performance gains may not be as high as the other ~completion-read~ APIs.

* Installation
- Get the package, either from MELPA (soon to come):

  : M-x package-install RET fussy RET
  Or clone / download this repository and modify your ~load-path~:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
    (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/fussy/" user-emacs-directory))
  #+end_src
* Straight Example
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package fussy
    :ensure t
    :straight
    (fussy :type git :host github :repo "jojojames/fussy")
    :config
    (push 'fussy completion-styles)
    (setq
     ;; For example, project-find-file uses 'project-files which uses
     ;; substring completion by default. Set to nil to make sure it's using
     ;; flx.
     completion-category-defaults nil
     completion-category-overrides nil))
#+end_src

* Scoring Backends
We default to [[https://github.com/lewang/flx][flx]] for scoring matches but
additional (listed below) scoring functions/backends can be used.
** Flx
[[https://github.com/lewang/flx][flx]] is a dependency of ~fussy~ and the default
scoring algorithm.

~flx~ has a great scoring algorithm but is one of the slower implementations
compared to the other scoring backends written as native modules.
** Flx-rs
[[https://github.com/jcs-elpa/flx-rs][flx-rs]] is a native module written in Rust
that matches the original ~flx~ scoring algorithm. It is about 10 times faster
than the original implementation written in Emacs Lisp. We can use this package
instead for extra performance with the same scoring strategy.

One downside of this package is that it doesn't yet support using ~flx~'s file
cache so filename matching is currently slightly worse than the original Emacs
lisp implementation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package flx-rs
    :ensure t
    :straight
    (flx-rs
     :repo "jcs-elpa/flx-rs"
     :fetcher github
     :files (:defaults "bin"))
    :config
    (setq fussy-score-fn 'flx-rs-score)
    (flx-rs-load-dyn))
#+end_src

** Fuz
Another option is to use the [[https://github.com/rustify-emacs/fuz.el][fuz]]
library (also in Rust) for scoring.

This library has two fuzzy matching algorithms, ~skim~ and ~clangd~.

Skim: Just like [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] v2, the algorithm is
based on Smith-Waterman algorithm which is normally used in DNA sequence alignment

Clangd: The algorithm is based on clangd's
[[https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls/blob/master/src/fuzzy_match.cc][FuzzyMatch.cpp]].

For more information: [[https://github.com/lotabout/fuzzy-matcher][fuzzy-matcher]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package fuz
    :ensure nil
    :straight (fuz :type git :host github :repo "rustify-emacs/fuz.el")
    :config
    (setq fussy-score-fn 'fussy-fuz-score)
    (unless (require 'fuz-core nil t)
      (fuz-build-and-load-dymod)))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  ;; Same as fuz but with prebuilt binaries.
  (use-package fuz-bin
    :ensure t
    :straight
    (fuz-bin
     :repo "jcs-elpa/fuz-bin"
     :fetcher github
     :files (:defaults "bin"))
    :config
    (setq fussy-score-fn 'fussy-fuz-bin-score)
    (fuz-bin-load-dyn))
#+end_src
** Liquid Metal
A mimetic poly-alloy of the Quicksilver scoring algorithm,
essentially LiquidMetal.

Flex matching short abbreviations against longer strings is a boon in
productivity for typists.  Applications like Quicksilver, Alfred, LaunchBar, and
Launchy have made this method of keyboard entry a popular one. It's time to
bring this same functionality to web controls. LiquidMetal makes scoring long
strings against abbreviations easy.

For more information: [[https://github.com/rmm5t/liquidmetal][liquidmetal]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package liquidmetal
    :ensure t
    :straight t
    :config
    (setq fussy-score-fn 'fussy-liquidmetal-score))
#+end_src

** Sublime-Fuzzy
Fuzzy matching algorithm based on Sublime Text's string search.
Iterates through characters of a search string and calculates a score.
This is another fuzzy implementation written in Rust.

For more information: [[https://github.com/Schlechtwetterfront/fuzzy-rs][fuzzy-rs]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package sublime-fuzzy
    :ensure t
    :straight
    (sublime-fuzzy
     :repo "jcs-elpa/sublime-fuzzy"
     :fetcher github
     :files (:defaults "bin"))
    :config
    (setq fussy-score-fn 'fussy-sublime-fuzzy-score)
    (sublime-fuzzy-load-dyn))
#+end_src
** Hotfuzz
This is a fuzzy Emacs completion style similar to the built-in flex style, but
with a better scoring algorithm. Specifically, it is non-greedy and ranks
completions that match at word; path component; or camelCase boundaries higher.

For more information: [[https://github.com/axelf4/hotfuzz][hotfuzz]]

Note, ~hotfuzz~ has its own ~completion-style~ that may be worth using over this one.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package hotfuzz
    :ensure t
    :straight t
    :config
    (setq fussy-score-fn 'fussy-hotfuzz-score))
#+end_src

* Filtering Choices
Before scoring and sorting candidates, we must somehow filter them from the
completion table. The approaches below are several ways to do that, each with
varying advantages and disadvantages.

For the choices below, we benchmark the functions by benchmarking the entire
~fussy-all-completions~ function with the below macro calling ~M-x
describe-symbol (30000 candidates)~ in the scratch buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (defmacro fussy--measure-time (&rest body)
    "Measure the time it takes to evaluate BODY.
  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2008-06/msg00087.html"
    `(let ((time (current-time)))
       (let ((result ,@body))
         (message "%.06f" (float-time (time-since time)))
         result)))
#+end_src

** Flex
This is the default filtering method and is 1:1 to the filtering done
when using the ~flex~ ~completion-style~. Advantages are no additional
dependencies (e.g. ~orderless~) and likely bug-free/stable to use.

The only disadvantage is that it's the slowest of the filtering methods.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes

  ;; Flex
  (setq fussy-filter-fn 'fussy-filter-flex)
  ;; Type Letter a
  ;; 0.078952
  ;; Type Letter b
  ;; 0.052590
  ;; Type Letter c
  ;; 0.065808
  ;; Type Letter d
  ;; 0.061254
  ;; Type Letter e
  ;; 0.098000
  ;; Type Letter f
  ;; 0.053321
  ;; Type Letter g
  ;; 0.050180
#+end_src

** Fast
This is another useable filtering method and leverages the ~all-completions~ API
written in C to do its filtering. It seems to be the fastest of the filtering
methods from quick benchmarking as well as requiring no additional dependencies
(e.g. ~orderless~).

Implementation may be buggy though, so use with caution.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  ;; Fast
  (setq fussy-filter-fn 'fussy-filter-fast)
  ;; Type Letter a
  ;; 0.030671
  ;; Type Letter b
  ;; 0.030247
  ;; Type Letter c
  ;; 0.036047
  ;; Type Letter d
  ;; 0.032071
  ;; Type Letter e
  ;; 0.034785
  ;; Type Letter f
  ;; 0.030392
  ;; Type Letter g
  ;; 0.033473
#+end_src
** Orderless
[[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][orderless]] can also be used for
filtering.  It uses the ~all-completions~ API like ~fussy-filter-fast~ so is
also faster than the default filtering but has a dependency on ~orderless~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  ;; Orderless
  (setq fussy-filter-fn 'fussy-filter-orderless)
  ;; Type Letter a
  ;; 0.065390
  ;; Type Letter b
  ;; 0.036942
  ;; Type Letter c
  ;; 0.054091
  ;; Type Letter d
  ;; 0.048816
  ;; Type Letter e
  ;; 0.074258
  ;; Type Letter f
  ;; 0.040900
  ;; Type Letter g
  ;; 0.037928
#+end_src

To use [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][orderless]] filtering:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package orderless
    :straight t
    :ensure t
    :commands (orderless-filter))

  (setq fussy-filter-fn 'fussy-filter-orderless)
#+end_src
* Company Integration
Fuzzy completion may or may not be too slow when completing with
[[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][company-mode]].

For this, we can advise ~company-capf~ to use basic completions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes

  (defconst OG-COMPLETION-STYLES completion-styles
    "Original `completion-styles' Emacs comes with.")

  (defun company-capf-with-og-completion-styles (f &rest args)
    "Set `completion-styles' to be the default Emacs `completion-styles'
  while `company-capf' runs."
    (let ((completion-styles OG-COMPLETION-STYLES))
      (apply f args)))

  (advice-add 'company-capf :around 'company-capf-with-og-completion-styles)
#+end_src

Another option is to only apply fuzzy matching later in the query.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (defun company-capf-smart-completion-styles (f &rest args)
    "Change which `completion-style' to use based off `company-prefix'."
    (let ((completion-styles
           (if (length< company-prefix 3)
               '(basic partial-completion emacs22)
             '(fussy basic partial-completion emacs22))))
      (apply f args)))

(advice-add 'company-capf :around 'company-capf-smart-completion-styles)
#+end_src

If you intend to run ~company-capf~ with ~fussy~, then use the below
~company-transformer~ to sort matches based off ~fussy~ scoring.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (setq company-transformers
        '(fussy-company-sort-by-completion-score))
#+end_src
* Eglot Integration

Eglot by default uses ~flex~ in ~completion-category-defaults~.
Use this to override that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (with-eval-after-load 'eglot
    (add-to-list 'completion-category-overrides
                 '(eglot (styles fussy basic))))
#+end_src
* Helm Integration
Integration with [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] is possible by
setting ~helm-completion-style~ to ~emacs~ instead of ~helm~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq helm-completion-style 'emacs)
#+end_src

For more information:
https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/blob/master/helm-mode.el#L269

* Ivy Integration
Since ~ivy~ doesn't support ~completion-styles~, we have to hack ~fussy~ into it.
We can advise ~ivy--flx-sort~ and replace it with our own sorting function.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(defun ivy--fussy-sort (name cands)
  "Sort according to closeness to string NAME the string list CANDS."
  (condition-case nil
      (let* ((bolp (= (string-to-char name) ?^))
             ;; An optimized regex for fuzzy matching
             ;; "abc" → "^[^a]*a[^b]*b[^c]*c"
             (fuzzy-regex (concat "\\`"
                                  (and bolp (regexp-quote (substring name 1 2)))
                                  (mapconcat
                                   (lambda (x)
                                     (setq x (char-to-string x))
                                     (concat "[^" x "]*" (regexp-quote x)))
                                   (if bolp (substring name 2) name)
                                   "")))
             ;; Strip off the leading "^" for flx matching
             (flx-name (if bolp (substring name 1) name))
             cands-left
             cands-to-sort)

        ;; Filter out non-matching candidates
        (dolist (cand cands)
          (when (string-match-p fuzzy-regex cand)
            (push cand cands-left)))

        ;; pre-sort the candidates by length before partitioning
        (setq cands-left (cl-sort cands-left #'< :key #'length))

        ;; partition the candidates into sorted and unsorted groups
        (dotimes (_ (min (length cands-left) ivy-flx-limit))
          (push (pop cands-left) cands-to-sort))

        (nconc
         ;; Compute all of the flx scores in one pass and sort
         (mapcar #'car
                 (sort (mapcar
                        (lambda (cand)
                          (cons cand
                                (car

                                  cand flx-name
                                  ivy--flx-cache))))
                        cands-to-sort)
                       (lambda (c1 c2)
                         ;; Break ties by length
                         (if (/= (cdr c1) (cdr c2))
                             (> (cdr c1)
                                (cdr c2))
                           (< (length (car c1))
                              (length (car c2)))))))
         ;; Add the unsorted candidates
         cands-left))
    (error cands)))

(advice-add 'ivy--flx-sort :override 'ivy--fussy-sort)

* Recommendations

User is recommended to try the various scoring functions. See ~fussy-score-fn~.

For speed, ~flx-rs~ or ~fuz/fuz-bin~ will be the most performant but uses Rust.

~flx-rs~ will provide an algorithm that matches the original ~flx~ algorithm.

Below is a sample config that uses ~flx-rs~ for improved performance.

~fuz-bin~ or ~fuz~ also seem to be slightly faster than ~flx-rs~ and uses a different algorithm.

    :config
    (setq fussy-score-fn 'flx-rs-score)

    (push 'fussy completion-styles)
    (setq
     ;; For example, project-find-file uses 'project-files which uses
     ;; substring completion by default. Set to nil to make sure it's using
     ;; flx.
     completion-category-defaults nil
     completion-category-overrides nil)

    ;; `eglot' defaults to flex, so set an override to point to fussy instead.
    (with-eval-after-load 'eglot
      (add-to-list 'completion-category-overrides
